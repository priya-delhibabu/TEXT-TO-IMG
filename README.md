## 📌 Project Summary

This repository contains 3 tasks focused on text preprocessing and text-to-image generation using NLP and GAN models.

### ✅ Task 1 – Text Tokenization & Encoding
- Used a pre-trained BERT model to tokenize and encode text inputs.
- Outputs embeddings used for further processing.

📂 Folder: `TASK1`

---

### ✅ Task 2 – Text Preprocessing with Transformers
- Used Hugging Face Transformers to preprocess text into tokenized and encoded format.
- Generated embeddings used for image generation.

📂 Folder: `TASK2`

---

### ✅ Task 3 – Text to Image Generation Pipeline
- Built a pipeline using embeddings from Task 2.
- Used GAN-based model to simulate image generation from text.
- Basic interface included.

📂 Folder: `TASK3`
